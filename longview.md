title: The Digital Humanities Long View&#58; A Joint Seminar Series
---

Research happens in context. But, how did Digital Humanities (DH) get here? This seminar series explores the socio-historical, -political and -cultural contexts of DH research as a means of building understanding of how we all ended up here and what that means for the future of the field. It’s an opportunity for newcomers to understand how the field has developed, and for established practitioners to consider their work as part of a larger movement with competing influences, ambitions, and blindspots. Papers may take an “insider” or “outsider” view of DH, that is, papers may be positioned within the discipline of DH or take a comparative approach that situates DH in a wider disciplinary, social, cultural and/or historical context.

This seminar series is co-hosted by scholars living eight time zones apart, and therefore the times of sessions vary to allow thed greatest possible access to people based at different points on the globe. It is both an experiment to push the (social) boundaries of a virtual seminar series, and a bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres who are committed to rich international discussions from a range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice.

*Co-hosted by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities & the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford. Convenors: Drs Giovanna Ceserani (Stanford), Adam Crymble (UCL), Julianne Nyhan (UCL), Laura Stokes (Stanford), Agnieszka Backman (Stanford).*
