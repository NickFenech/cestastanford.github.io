<p>Technology is global, but where we live affects how we apply digital solutions to humanities work. We all have what Roopika Risam described as a digital humanities (DH) “accent”. This seminar series explores those accents by looking at DH research here, and there, and over there too. This is a chance to build greater global awareness and empathy about regional and local approaches to digital humanities in the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>It’s an opportunity for newcomers to understand how the field has developed differently around the globe, and for established practitioners to consider their work as part of a larger movement with competing influences, ambitions, and blindspots.</p>

<p>This seminar series is co-hosted by scholars living in three countries, nine time zones apart. Building upon our successful “Digital Humanities Long View” series (2021), this is a further bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres to promote a global conversation. We are committed to fostering rich international discussions from a diverse range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice.</p>

<p><em>Co-hosted by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, the Centre for Digital Humanities, Uppsala, and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford.</em></p>

<p><em>Convenors: Drs Agnieszka Backman (Uppsala), Giovanna Ceserani (Stanford), Adam Crymble (UCL), Nick Fenech (Stanford), Anna Foka (Uppsala), Julianne Nyhan (UCL), Laura Stokes (Stanford), Clelia Rose La Monica (Uppsala).</em></p>
