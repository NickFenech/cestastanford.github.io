<p><strong><em>WHAT?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>Research happens in context. But how did Digital Humanities (DH) get here? This seminar series explores the socio-historical, political, and cultural contexts of DH research to better understand how the field got to where it is and what this means for the future of the field.</p>

<p><strong><em>WHO?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>This series is an opportunity for newcomers to understand how the field has developed, and for established practitioners to consider their work as part of a larger movement with competing influences, ambitions, and blind spots. Papers may be positioned within the discipline of DH or take a comparative approach that situates DH in a wider disciplinary, social, cultural and/or historical context.</p>

<p><strong><em>WHERE?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>This seminar series is co-hosted by scholars living eight time zones apart, and therefore the times of sessions vary to allow the greatest possible access to people based at different points on the globe. It is both an experiment to push the (social) boundaries of a virtual seminar series, and a transatlantic bridging of digital humanities centers that are committed to rich international discussions from a range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice.</p>

<p><em>Co-hosted by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities & the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford. Convenors: Drs Giovanna Ceserani (Stanford), Adam Crymble (UCL), Julianne Nyhan (UCL), Laura Stokes (Stanford), Agnieszka Backman (Stanford).</em></p>
